    Title: USPTO Data Set API
    Description: The Data Set API (DSAPI) allows the public users to discover and
      search USPTO exported data sets. This is a generic API that allows USPTO users
      to make any CSV based data files searchable through API. With the help of GET
      call, it returns the list of data fields that are searchable. With the help
      of POST call, data can be fetched based on the filters on the field names. Please
      note that POST call is used to search the actual data. The reason for the POST
      call is that it allows users to specify any complex search criteria without
      worry about the GET size limitations as well as encoding of the input parameters.
